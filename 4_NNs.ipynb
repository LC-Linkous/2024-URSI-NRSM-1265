        "**Tutorial 4** : Neural Networks\n",
        "\n",
        "Using data and example filters from the last tutorial, here several basic Neural Networks (NNs) are used to classify the data into different categories. Not all parameter combinations result in valid antenna designs, and the applied filters check minimal conditions to keep the tutorials brief.\n",
        "\n",
        "NNs are a group of machine learning models inspired (and named after) the human brain. They have layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that activate when set conditions are met. These networks are designed to recognize patterns. NNs have a training stage in order to train this pattern recognition.\n",
        "\n",
        "NNS can be used in both supervised and unsupervised learning, depending on what task they are being applied to. In supervised learning, the NN is trained on labeled data (such as our data set) and the network learns to map inputs to specific outputs. During the supervised training process, the network makes predictions (the output) and compares these predictions to the labels (known 'ground truth' values). The error between the prediction and the labels are used to adjust weights (connections between layers and nodes). This is called backpropagation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In unsupervised learning, the NN is trained on unlabeled data (or the labels are ignored) in order to find clusters or other relations between data.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "There are 3 key components to structuring a neural network:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **The input layer**. This is where the input data is fed into the network. Each node is a feature of the input data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **The hidden layer(s)**. NNs need at least one hidden, middle layer. This is the layer that process the data from the input layer and learn the patterns linked to identification in the output layer. There are different techniques to create the hidden layers, some of which will be discussed in this tutorial. Others are linked in the references.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) **The output layer**. This is how the network produces its prediction. The prediction can be, for example, a class identifier (predicted antenna frequency) or a numerical value (predicted width). Even with highly accurate models, these outputs are called **predictions**.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial series, several operations are performed using the W/L ratio of the rectangular patch. This is used as a shortcut for normalizing length and width parameters between frequencies for comparison. Data processing, filtering, and ML training does not need to use this as a standard.\n",
        "\n",
        "While some preprocessing is necessary for machine learning in order to format data, this level of processing is not always needed. Typically, preprocessing must remove or handle missing data (NaNs, missing entries, improperly recorded data). For cleaner results, outliers should be detected and removed (especially in small sets), and some normalization may be needed depending on the data format. NNS tend to work better when data is normalized, especially when there is a large range of feature values. For instance, if one feature ranges from 0 to 0.5, while other features range from 0 to 500, then this may cause the smaller feature to be overshadowed in the training.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Demonstrated below are the following tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Importing the data from a .csv into a pandas dataframe\n",
        "* Checking the dataframe for NAN or empty values\n",
        "* Reading columns in the dataframe into a variable\n",

        "The following examples uses the singular case of W/L Ratio vs. Gain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than using both examples from above, only the 'W/L Ratio vs. Gain' data is used because it is the one of the two that is linearly separable. This is was important in tutorial 3 because support vector machines (SVMs) aim to find the optimal hyperplane that separates data points into different classes with the largest possible margin, thereby maximizing the generalization ability of the model. In this tutorial, linear separability makes it possible to use lower-dimensional NNs in order to classify data. This is more important as an example than it is in practical use. However, it is important to recognize that for more complex problems, broader and deeper NNs may be necessary for any kind of classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several important terms to know when experimenting with NNs.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Features**: Features are the individual characteristics of the data (e.g., W, L, f, h) used as input to a model. They represent the measured or known attributes that the NN can use to make predictions about the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Input**: The input refers to the data fed into a ML model or NN for processing. In supervised learning, inputs typically consist of the features of your data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Training**:  Training is the process where a machine learning model learns from data by adjusting its parameters (such as weights in a neural network). During training, the model is provided with labeled data (input-output pairs), and it adjusts to minimize the error between its predictions and the actual outcomes (using algorithms like gradient descent).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Forward Propagation**:  Forward propagation is the process of passing input data through a neural network from the input layer to the output layer, layer by layer. In this process, the data is transformed by weights, biases, and activation functions to produce an output (or prediction). The NN model (or structure) is not updated at this step.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Weights**: Control how much influence each input has on the output. Each connection moving forward in the network has a weight. These weights control the influence of each connection between neurons.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Bias**: Bias values are generally optional. They are similar to weights, but rather than being a connection between neurons, they are a direct input to a neuron. These values add a numerical constant adjustment to the weighted sum of inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Activation Function**: Each neuron has an activation function that decides if that neuron 'fires', or activated. If the input to the neuron is below the threshold needed for activation, then the neuron's output is a 0 (or other value that indicates the neuron was not activated). These also introduce non-linearity, enabling neural networks to learn complex patterns in data.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Predictions**: Predictions are the outputs generated by a model after processing the input data through the forward propagation process. In supervised learning, the predictions are the model’s estimated values or class labels for the given input. Even in highly accurate models, the output is referred to as a prediction as there is always a percentage of uncertainty for misclassification.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Backpropagation**: Backpropagation is a key technique used for training neural networks. It is the process of computing the loss function (or gradient of difference between prediction and label), with respect to the network’s weights and biases, and then updating those weights to minimize the error. It works by calculating the error at the output, then propagating it backward through the network to adjust the weights.\n",
