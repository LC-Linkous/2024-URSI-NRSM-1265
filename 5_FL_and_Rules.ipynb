        "\n",
        "This tutorial breaks from the others in that it does not use the provided data. Fuzzy logic (FL) in terms of optimization and modeling is generally part of a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) or another system that uses FL to come to a decision. Similarly, Rules-Based systems (the less-flexible counterpart of a Fuzzy Logic system), are part of a large controller used to make decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "These two methods are important in terms of the **design** of the antennas we have been looking at for the last 4 tutorials. The data collected for those tutorials was from an iterative batch collection that took multiple weeks and multiple simulation machines to collect. Data can have important insights into the behavior and design process. However, with only 3 sampled designs of a single topology, this is not sufficient to adapt to unknown designs.\n",
        "\n",
        "One potential method of addressing this problem is Reinforcement Learning (RL).\n",

        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reinforcement learning** is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The goal of reinforcement learning is for the agent (software, object) to learn a policy (a set of actions) that maximizes a cumulative reward over time. The agent explores the environment, takes actions, and receives feedback (in the form of rewards or penalties) that helps it improve its behavior.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Reinforcement learning is a type of online machine learning (Online ML). Online ML is a type of machine learning where the model is trained incrementally as new data arrives, rather than being trained all at once on a large dataset (as in traditional \"batch\" learning, which was seen in the previous tutorial). In online learning, the model is updated continuously as more data is collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in order to facilitate this model update, there must be some guidelines for how the model is updated. These guidelines can take several forms, but commonly a mathematical model is used to describe the behavior of the agent in the system. This includes limits to what the outputs are, and what to do if invalid inputs are entered.\n",
        "\n",
        "A simple Rules-Based controlled system might consist of a series of IF-ELSE statements to decide on the next steps based on a small number of controllable parameters. This is useful if the number of potential actions (or changeable variables) is small.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the system behavior is complex, then using fuzzy logic to incorporate less strict decision making policies may be beneficial. A Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) is a control system based on fuzzy logic rather than traditional binary (true/false) logic. It is designed to handle reasoning that is approximate rather than precise, and it works well in situations where uncertainty, imprecision, or vagueness exists in the system being controlled. In contrast to classical control systems (which rely on precise, numerical input), fuzzy logic allows for a more human-like way of reasoning, making it ideal for complex systems where exact mathematical models are difficult or impossible to derive.\n",
